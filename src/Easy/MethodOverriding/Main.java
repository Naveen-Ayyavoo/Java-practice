Easy Problem â€“ Animal Inheritance
Problem:
Create a base class called Animal with a method makeSound().
Then, create two derived classes: Dog and Cat. Override the makeSound() method in both to print "Bark" and "Meow" respectively.
Write a main method to demonstrate polymorphism.

Key Concepts Practiced:
Basic inheritance
Method overriding
Polymorphism
